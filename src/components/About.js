        The original Tumindig artwork started a movement with other artists making derivatives by adding their own raised-fist avatar in solidarity with the sole raised-fist in the original artwork.[3][5] Raymundo himself made available a blank template of the raised-fist icon to encourage others to create their own avatars.[6]

Raymundo released a website which showcase a version of Tumindig created from a compilation of customized raised-fist icons created by other individuals and groups. It also provides a form where one could submit their own raised-fist avatar so that it could be added to the compilation as well as a link to voter's registration page of the Commission on Election so they would be eligible to vote in the 2022 Philippine general election. [7]

Toy maker Gino Roberto came up with a resin figure of the raised-fist character. With consent from Raymundo he announced that he would be selling copies of the figure with part of the proceeds to be given to the Philippine Animation Workers Association (PAWA).[8]

Other derivative works in other mediums were created from the raised-fist character of Tumindig.[9] The character was also used as effigies and other paraphernalia in protests during the 2021 State of the Nation Address.[2][7]
