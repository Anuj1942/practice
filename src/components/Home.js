        The original Tumindig artwork was created by Filipino satirist and cartoonist Kevin Eric Raymundo.[2] Raymundo is known for his web comic series Tarantadong Kalbo which has been running for two years at the time of Tumindig's release. He is also known by the name of his comic series.[1]

The original illustration was published on July 17, 2021 and was posted in Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.[3]

Raymundo said he created the digital artwork out of frustration over the Philippine government response against the COVID-19 pandemic.[4]

The original artwork depicts rows of blue anthromorphic fists bowing in submission except for one glowing white raised-fist character.
